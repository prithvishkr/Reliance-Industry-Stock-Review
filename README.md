# Reliance-Industry-Stock-Review
This consist of my version of reviewing Reliance Stock Data From 2000-2020

In this version I included 2 financial charts :-

1. OHLC-
  The OHLC chart (for open, high, low and close) is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close values for a given x     coordinate (most likely time). The tip of the lines represent the low and high values and the horizontal segments represent the open and   close values. Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default,   increasing items are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.
2. Candlestick Chart-
  The candlestick chart is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given x coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the open and close values and the lines represent the spread between the low and high values. Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.
  
 
Reliance share price was highest in 2008.

Reliance Industries, the biggest wealth creator for five consecutive years from 2007 to 2011, has emerged as the largest wealth destroyer between 2008-13

In start of 2020 it was a good performer but it has gone down with the pandemic and in the coming time i hope to see it perform well in coming time.

Its a good long term stock.
